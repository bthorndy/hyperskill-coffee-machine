# coffee-machine
A Java project from the Hyperskill learning platform.
This application simulates a coffee machine. The user can add ingredients or request a cup of coffee and the machine keeps track of the current levels of ingredients.

## Project structure
Most of the top level folders contain instruction files for the stages of the project. My own code for the application can be found in [task/src/machine](task/src/machine).
